This tape provides a complete set of information available from the Railroad Commission of Texas
on the Organization Report (P-5) System. This tape will provide information on all organizations
that have properly filed Form P-5 with the Commission.


There are sixteen (16) records used internally by Railroad Commission personnel in the
Organization Report (P-5) System. The first fifteen (15) records (Organization numbers (000001-
000015) are RRC Office Designations for RRC personnel. Organization number 123456 is a test
record used to train personnel. These records will not be duplicated onto the tape.


Information is placed on the tape in a manner which shows a relational structure between the
various record types that can exist for a given organization. The exception is the type '1T' record,
which does not relate to a particular organization, but can be used to set up a table of all valid
specialty codes and activity indicators. Each organization consists of one or more of the record
types described below. Each organization has at least a type 'A ' record while other records may
exist when additional information is available. If a value "H", hold-mail-code, appears in any
organization's 'A ' Hold-mail-code data field, this means all of the mailing addresses within this
organization are invalid (e.g., 'A ', 'F', 'H ', 'J ' and 'K ' records).




                                                I.3
RECORD TYPES AND DEFINITIONS
RECORD ID DEFINITION
'1T'           (Specialty code/activity indicator table records) These records identify all valid
               activity indicators and spec-ialty codes currently in use by the Railroad
               Commission.
The following code types are represented by these records:
        Code Type       Definition
        --------- -----------
          AD            This code is used internally by the Commission to identify a special
                        address used when mailing a P-5 renewal form.
          AI            ACTIVITY INDICATOR - This field shows activity in which an
                        organization may be involved. For example, organizations may be
                        gatherers of gas or condensate, or they may have oil allowables. Each
                        organization participating in these activities will have a corresponding 'U'
                        record to indicate these specific activities regulated by the Railroad
                        Commission.
                Activity Code          Description
                 CSGD/G                Casinghead Gas Gatherer

                 G/PUR                 Gas Purchaser
                 GTHS/G                Gas Gatherer

                 SEC/RC                This code is no longer used.


          SR            SPECIALTY CODE - This type of specialty code serves two purposes:
                                1. This code type allows for multiple addresses, that is, multiple 'F '
                                records of the same specialty code for an organization.
                                2. This code type indicates that the organization is currently
                                involved in a specific operation as defined by the specialty code.
               Note: There will not be any 'H ' district records associated with "SR" records.

SN         SPECIALTY CODE - This type of specialty code indicates district
           addresses. "SN" does not indicate kinds of operations in which an
           organization may be involved. Only "AI" and "SR" types indicate kinds
           of operations in which an organization may be involved. "SN" allows
           only one address, that is, only one 'F ' record of the same specialty code
           per organization; however, there may be multiple district ('H ') records
           associated with the same specialty code.

                                "SN" Specialty Codes Algorithms


There are two types of search algorithms used to locate an "SN" specialty code's district mailing
address.
       1. Specific Hierarchical "SN" Specialty Code District Address Search. This involves
       seven (7) "SN" specialty codes.
       2. General "SN" Specialty Code District Address Search. This involves the remainder of
       the "SN" specialty codes.
The Specific Hierarchical "SN" Specialty Code District Address Search Algorithm involves the
following seven (7) "SN" specialty codes:
1. CONTRL             Controls district/field mailings unless specific control set
2. GATHER             Gatherer of gas, oil, or condensate mailing control
3. GATH-G             Gatherer of gas mailing control
4. GATH-O             Gatherer of oil mailing control
5. OPRATR             Operator of oil/and of gas wells mailing control
6. OPRGAS             Operator of gas well mailing control
7. OPROIL             Operator of oil well mailing control


These seven specialty codes are hierarchically related.
